# Overview {-}

This compendium contains all the material used to generate the final report.

**Components**

- **Research Journal** Meeting notes and emails.
- **Python Extraction Code** Exploratory analysis and process data to a config and data spreadsheet.
- **R and RJAGS** Take the data from the config/data sheets and format into JAGS input. Then post-process the output.

**Not Included**

- **Data** So that this compendium can be uploaded to Github without paying for a private repo.
    + **2486** rows of mass flow / whp data from multiple sources.
    + **420** rows of times-series mass flow data from PI.
    + **One** 64.4 MB spreadsheet from Contact that has crashed my computer many times.
- **Raw Outputs**
    + **456** MB of output traces.
    + **Blood**, sweat and tears, which do not aid the communication of my work.

This document is automatically generated thanks to Bookdown and Rstudio. (I swear, it only took a few hours to convert my source code into this).

Compilation requires data in `(root)/wairakei_data/*.xlsx`, i.e., you won't be able to run any of the code but it's been pre-run for you. Raw data is confidential - contact Contact for access. The config file `/wairakei_data/config.xlsx` also may contain confidential data and is not committed, as is the entire `/wairakei_data/` folder.
