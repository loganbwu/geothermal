# Overview {-}

This compendium contains all the material used to generate the final report. It is automatically generated thanks to Bookdown and Rstudio. (I swear, it only took a few hours to convert my source code into this.)

Compilation requires data in `(root)/wairakei_data/*.xlsx`, i.e., you won't be able to run any of the code but it's been pre-run for you. Raw data is confidential - contact Contact for access. The config file `/wairakei_data/config.xlsx` also may contain confidential data and is not committed, as is the entire `/wairakei_data/` folder.

## Components {-}

- **\@ref(motivation) [Motivation]** Basically an exec summary.
- **\@ref(research-journal) [Research Journal]** Meeting notes and emails.
- **\@ref(initial-plots) [Initial Plots]** Recreation of the provided Excel worksheet.
- **\@ref(python-extraction-code) [Python Extraction Code]** Exploratory analysis and process data to a config and data spreadsheet.
- **\@ref(r-jags-and-rjags) [R, JAGS, and RJAGS]** Takes the data from the config/data sheets and format into JAGS input. Then post-processes the output. This is the program used to create the report outputs.

## Non-components {-}

(Not included)

- **Data** So that this compendium can be uploaded to Github without paying for a private repo.
    + **2486** rows of mass flow / whp data from multiple sources.
    + **420** rows of time-series mass flow data from PI.
    + **74.5** MB of spreadsheets from Contact that have crashed my computer many times.
- **Raw Outputs**
    + **456** MB of output traces -- 10,000 samples of 5654 variables.
    + **Blood**, sweat and tears, which do not aid the communication of my work.
