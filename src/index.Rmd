# Home

This compendium contains all the material used to generate the final report.

Components:

- **Research Journal**: Meeting notes and emails.
- **Python Extraction Code**: Exploratory analysis and process data to a config and data spreadsheet.
- **R and RJAGS**: Take the data from the config/data sheets and format into JAGS input. Then post-process the output.

This document is automatically generated thanks to Bookdown and Rstudio. (I swear, it only took a few hours to convert my source code into this).

Compilation requires data in `(root)/wairakei_data/*.xlsx`. Raw data is confidential - contact Contact for access.
The config file `/wairakei_data/config.xlsx` also may contain confidential data and is not committed, as is the entire `/wairakei_data/` folder.
