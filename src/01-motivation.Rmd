# Motivation

The Wairakei geothermal field is one of the oldest geothermal electricity producers in the world. The current operator, Contact Energy Ltd., gathers a huge amount of data for the purposes of monitoring the state of the field. The problem is, dealing with this data is *hard*. Although it is available in vast quantities, it isn't necessarily complete -- some facilities don't have all the meters they'd like, and there are some things you just can't physically measure.

## What's the problem?

The problem is uncertainty, or rather, the lack of it. Things in nature aren't perfectly deterministic, especially when there are things we don't know or are trying to predict. [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) and [Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) are two methods that go hand in hand to incorporate uncertainty.

However, they have remained the domain of experienced statisticians and economists. You'll never find a Bayesian or Monte Carlo function in Excel. Despite energy being a field where forecasting uncertainty is important, the Wairakei operators still use deterministic methods.
